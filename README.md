# rustcalc
A programmable calculator in pure rust

Compile it with `cargo run`. You must be on rust nightly.

This calculator uses its own scripting language which I shall arbitrarily dub "RCScript". By the end of this project, this language will be able to do most of what a vanilla python installation should be able to do with regards to math and simple programs.
